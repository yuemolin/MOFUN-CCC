<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Introduction

MOFUN-CCC (Multi Omics FUsion Neural network- Computational Cell Counting) is a multi-modal deep learning algorithm that operates under a supervised framework, leveraging intermediate fusion techniques to process bulk gene expression and bulk DNA methylation data. Its primary objective is to generate absolute cell counts as its output.

During the training process, informative features were selected using marginal linear regression. To address the issue of dissimilar distributions between the two data modalities, the gene expression data (measured as TPM for RNA-seq or intensity for microarray) were transformed into log space, and the DNA methylation data were represented as M values. Subsequently, both data modalities were re-scaled using min-max scaling to make the values in range of 0-1.  To mitigate the problem of varying cell counts, we further scaled each cell type by its median counts, resulting in each cell type having an approximate mean count of 1.

A data augmentation step is implemented as a preliminary stage before the training process. A natural assumption can be made that both the gene and DNAm data inherently share common cellular components. Based on that, our approach triples the training data by generating two separate copies with a zero mask, each representing a single modality input. This not only expands the dataset available for training, consequently mitigating the risk of overfitting but also equips the model with the capability to make predictions when only a single modality data is available.

The embedding module reduces the high-dimensional input into a low-dimensional feature. An intermediate fusion module is incorporated to enable information exchange between the gene and DNAm modalities, while shortcut connections allow the fused features to retain information from the original features, resulting in a more robust model even when only a single modality is available. Multiple fusion blocks generate mixed-information features, which are concatenated and passed to the output module for final prediction. The predicted cell counts will transformed back to raw space based on the median scaling factor.
